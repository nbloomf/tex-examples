LaTeX is a markup language for academic and technical writing. It is the defacto standard way to produce publication-ready documents in mathematics, including books and journal articles. The goal of this tutorial is to help you learn to use LaTeX to produce documents.

## Why should I learn LaTeX?

The only real answer to this question is "because you want to". You can certainly have a happy life without knowing anything at all about LaTeX, and it does have a steep learning curve.

BUT.

If you find yourself frequently writing complex equations, or writing documents with complicated cross-referencing or bibliographies, or wanting to publish a technical book or paper, or wanting to communicate math over the web, then LaTeX can make your life better in several concrete ways.

## What is LaTeX?

* **It is a markup language for technical writing.**
* **It is not a single monolithic program.** It is an ecosystem of tools that work together.
* **It gives the author control.** There are IDEs which behave like word processors, hiding away some of the details. Experienced users can also dig into the guts for more power.
* **It does not have a single designer.** Many people have worked together over many years to build and maintain the LaTeX ecosystem we have today.
* **It is not a commercial product.** You do not have to buy a license or get permission to use it.
* **It is industrial strength.** TeX, the software at the heart of the ecosystem, was explicitly designed for producing "camera-ready" books, and there are commercial publishing houses which use it.
* **It is designed for technical and academic text.** Complex equations and diagrams, cross references, bibliographies, numbering
