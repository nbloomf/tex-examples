We can make text \textbf{bold}, or \emph{italic}, or \texttt{monospaced}, or \underline{underlined}. Sometimes we need to use letters with gr\`{a}ve accents, \'{a}cute accents, \^{c}ircumflexes, \"{u}mlauts, l\H{o}ng umlauts, tild\~{e}s, \c{c}edillas, macr\={o}ns, under\b{b}ars, overd\.{o}ts, underd\d{o}ts, \r{r}ings, br\u{e}ves, hac\v{e}ks, and ti\t{es}. Dollar signs have to be escaped like \$. Backslashes are typed like \textbackslash, and tildes as \textasciitilde.

Take note that quotation marks are ``backticks and apostrophes''. Using ordinary "quotation marks" looks odd.
